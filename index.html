            Project's Use Case
        </p>
        <introduction>
            A wind-tunnel is a large tube-like apparatus that replicates the interaction between air and object moving through air. Wind tunnels have been around since the 18th century and are still important to analyse aerodynamic interactions. 
            Despite advanced computational software (CFD), hours of wind tunnel testing are still essential to the prototyping process. Designed to benefit all enthusiasts, <em>the Wind Tunnel Project</em> strives to inspire the spirit of research in aerodynamics. 
            The first step to furthering academic inquisitiveness in the subject is reliable analysis. The wind tunnel would allow you to study aerodynamic interactions, creating a strong foundation for any work in the subject.

        <h1>Working Concept</h1>
    
        <p class="home-spread-3-subtitle home-subtitle">How it works and it's application</p>
    
        <p>Consider this case of simple relativity where air is present all around - for there
             to be dynamic interaction between an object and the air surrounding it there must be some relative motion. We’re better acquainted with the more common occurrence of the object moving ahead and the air remaining untouched. </p>

                <img class="car-gif" src="car.gif"> 
                <p class="gif-caption"><strong>Fig 1.0</strong> Car in motion interacting with the air surrounding its body </p>
    
            </div>

                <p class="gif-caption"><strong>Fig 1.1</strong> <em>Stationary Wing</em> interacting with the moving around its mounted position</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>The object in motion interacts with the air around it, instantiating some aerodynamic forces on the surface of interaction. This is the case in <strong>Fig 1.0.</strong>
            It isn’t feasible to study this interaction when it occurs in this manner. 
            
            A simpler method that wouldn’t require you to move the object would be to move the air around the object instead. This method requires the air to be blown onto the stationary object, which is seen in <strong>Fig 1.1.</strong> In theory, both these instances produce the same aerodynamic interaction. The latter allows for a more suitable scientific observation.
            <br>
            This is the working principle of a Wind Tunnel.

            <h1>Project Brief</h1>
            <p>This low-cost aerodynamics kickstarter project is aimed at facilitating great aero ideas that would never leave the drawing board due to 
                the difficult idea-to-prototype cycle for aerospace engineering. This project aims to bridge that difficulty by equipping researchers and budding aerodynamicists who are limited in testing and putting their ideas out there by:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Circumstances</b> - Even for students in research departments with windtunnels, accessing them is not always easy. The 
                    project allows students to have a simple and reliable wind-tunnel at their disposal for repetitive initial testing.
                </li>
                <li><b>Finances</b> - Most students aren't able to afford the power tools required to build the windtunnels the traditional way. 
                    Expensive material, components, and hardware utilities are essential to have when it comes to such projects. 
                    This one, however, builds a reliable tunnel out of scrap material (cardboard) and low-cost equipment. <a href="/build.html#project-cost" >See where we are today.</a>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>Opportunity</b> - Many enthusiasts have several prototying ideas that never see enunciation due to the lack of verification apparatus. 
                    This windtunnel is a starting point in that journey. Perceiving the flow characteristics of new ideas in an empirical setting can be the basepoint for 
                    greater ideas in aeronautics.
